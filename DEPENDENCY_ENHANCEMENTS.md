# Dependency Enhancements for SpecPrint

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the SpecPrint system to improve task dependency management and visualization. The OpenAI LLM now generates sophisticated dependencies between tasks, and the UI provides rich dependency information and validation.

## üéØ Key Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced OpenAI LLM Dependency Generation**

#### **Improved System Prompt**
The backend system prompt has been significantly enhanced to generate more intelligent dependencies:

```go
DEPENDENCY RULES:
1. **Setup Dependencies**: Infrastructure and setup tasks should have no dependencies
2. **Logical Sequencing**: Tasks that depend on other tasks' outputs should reference them
3. **Phase Dependencies**: Implementation tasks should depend on design tasks
4. **Integration Dependencies**: API integration tasks should depend on backend tasks
5. **Testing Dependencies**: Test tasks should depend on the features they test
6. **Deployment Dependencies**: Deployment tasks should depend on all implementation tasks

COMMON DEPENDENCY PATTERNS:
- Database setup ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Frontend integration ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment
- Design system ‚Üí UI components ‚Üí Feature implementation ‚Üí Integration testing
- Authentication setup ‚Üí User management ‚Üí Protected features ‚Üí Security testing
- API design ‚Üí Backend implementation ‚Üí Frontend API calls ‚Üí End-to-end testing
```

#### **Example Generated Dependencies**
From the test output, we can see the LLM now generates logical dependency chains:

```
Task 1: Set up project repository (deps: none)
Task 2: Set up development environment (deps: none)
Task 3: Design database schema (deps: none)
Task 4: Implement user authentication API (deps: [1 2 3])
Task 5: Implement task management API (deps: [1 2 3])
Task 6: Implement task prioritization feature (deps: [5])
Task 7: Implement task status tracking feature (deps: [5])
Task 8: Design UI for user registration and login (deps: [4])
Task 9: Design UI for task management (deps: [5 6 7])
Task 10: Implement user registration and login UI (deps: [8])
Task 11: Implement task management UI (deps: [9])
Task 12: Implement dashboard UI (deps: [11])
Task 13: Write unit tests for authentication API (deps: [4])
Task 14: Write unit tests for task management API (deps: [5])
Task 15: Write integration tests for user flows (deps: [10 11])
Task 16: Conduct user acceptance testing (deps: [12 15])
Task 17: Prepare deployment configuration (deps: none)
Task 18: Deploy application to production (deps: [4 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17])
```

### 2. **Enhanced Task Card UI**

#### **Dependency Visualization**
Each task card now displays:
- **Dependency Count**: Shows completed vs total dependencies
- **Dependency Badges**: Color-coded badges for each dependency (green=completed, red=blocking)
- **Status Indicators**: "Ready" or "Blocked" status based on dependency completion
- **Warning Messages**: Clear indication when dependencies need to be completed

#### **Priority Display**
- Priority badges with color coding (red=high, yellow=medium, green=low)
- Visual hierarchy in task cards

#### **Enhanced Information**
- Task ID prominently displayed
- Time estimates clearly shown
- Dependency relationship visualization

### 3. **Dependency Validation & Enforcement**

#### **Drag & Drop Validation**
The system now prevents moving tasks with incomplete dependencies:
- Tasks can only be moved to "In Progress" or "Done" if all dependencies are completed
- Clear error messages explain why a task cannot be moved
- Tasks remain in "To Do" until dependencies are satisfied

#### **Real-time Status Updates**
- Task status updates automatically when dependencies are completed
- Visual feedback shows when tasks become "Ready" vs "Blocked"

### 4. **Dependency Overview Dashboard**

#### **Statistics Display**
The new dependency overview section shows:
- **Total Tasks**: Overall task count
- **Ready to Start**: Tasks with no dependencies or completed dependencies
- **Blocked**: Tasks waiting for dependencies to be completed
- **Have Dependencies**: Tasks that reference other tasks

#### **Visual Indicators**
- Color-coded statistics cards
- Warning messages for blocked tasks
- Clear guidance on next steps

### 5. **Enhanced Header Information**

#### **Dependency Status in Header**
The main header now shows:
- Task completion progress
- In-progress and remaining task counts
- Ready vs blocked task counts (when dependencies exist)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes**

#### **Enhanced System Prompt**
- More detailed dependency rules and patterns
- Better examples for the LLM to follow
- Improved task generation logic

#### **Task Structure**
```go
type Task struct {
    ID           int    `json:"id"`
    Title        string `json:"title"`
    Description  string `json:"description"`
    Dependencies []int  `json:"dependencies"`
    Priority     string `json:"priority"`
    Estimate     string `json:"estimate"`
}
```

### **Frontend Changes**

#### **TaskCard Component**

- Enhanced visual design with dependency information
- Priority and status indicators
- Dependency badge system

#### **KanbanBoard Component**
- Dependency validation in `handleTaskMove`
- Dependency statistics calculation
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### **Data Flow**

1. **PRD Input** ‚Üí OpenAI LLM generates tasks with dependencies
2. **Task Display** ‚Üí UI shows dependency information and status
3. **User Interaction** ‚Üí Drag & drop with dependency validation
4. **Status Updates** ‚Üí Real-time updates based on dependency completion
5. **Persistence** ‚Üí All changes saved to localStorage

4. **Complete Dependencies**: Mark prerequisite tasks as "Done"
5. **Move Tasks**: Drag tasks to "In Progress" once dependencies are complete
